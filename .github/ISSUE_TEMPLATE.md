<!--

Please note that lua-mongo is merely a binding to Mongo C Driver.
It neither adds nor subtracts anything within the supported API.

Before reporting an issue, please make sure the problem is with
lua-mongo itself rather than with MongoDB's syntax/features by
checking the following links:

MongoDB - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/
Mongo C Driver - http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/api.html

Issues unrelated to lua-mongo will be closed without a warning.
